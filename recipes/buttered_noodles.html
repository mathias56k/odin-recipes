    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Saucy, buttered noodles are simple to make and perfect to serve either as-is or alongside steak, chicken, or meatballs. Butter, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper are all you need for this quick and easy, kid-friendly dish, although fresh herbs and a little lemon juice could be added to amp up the flavor. It's such a delicious recipe, yet I get many questions on how to make it.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package fettuccine noodles</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons butter, cut into piece</li>
        <li>â…“ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in fettuccine, bring back to a boil, and cook pasta over medium heat until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and return pasta to pot.</li>
        <li>Mix butter, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper into pasta until evenly combined.</li>
    </ol>
